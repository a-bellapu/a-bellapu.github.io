## Introduction

The housing landscape of Bay Area has been profoundly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a reevaluation of rental dynamics and migration patterns. With remote work becoming the new norm for many industries, residents have begun to prioritize factors such as affordability, space, and quality of life over proximity to urban centers. Additionally, the area has experienced notable out-migration trends in the wake of the pandemic. The allure of the region, once synonymous with lucrative tech jobs and cultural vibrancy, has been tempered by concerns over affordability and quality of life. Residents, particularly those in the tech sector, have increasingly sought alternatives outside of the Bay Area, driven by factors such as remote work opportunities, housing affordability, and lifestyle preferences.

In this context, I attempt to understand the rental dynamics in the region. I unpack, **“what are some possible factors influencing rental variations in the Bay Area?”** 


## Data and Methodology

US Census Data API and Zillow Rental data


## Key Findings



### Temporal trends

From 2015 to 2023, there was notable variation in rents across different counties in the Bay Area. However, the onset of the pandemic brought about a sharp decline in rents specifically within San Francisco. Since then, rents in San Francisco have remained relatively low compared to other counties in the region, which have shown an upward trend. This divergence suggests a shift in rental market dynamics, with San Francisco experiencing a prolonged period of subdued rental prices while neighboring counties see a resurgence in rental demand and prices.

Zooming in on the data at a zip code level unveils that this trend is predominantly concentrated within the San Francisco - Oakland Metropolitan Area. A visual representation through mapping illustrates the extent of change in median rent across different zip codes over time. This granularity highlights the persistence of the phenomenon, showcasing how certain areas within the metropolitan region have experienced significant shifts in rental prices compared to others.

### Housing affordability

To delve deeper into housing affordability in the region, I analyze the rent burden, wherein households spend more than 30% of their income on rent, across various counties over different years. While each county demonstrates a reduction in rent burden over time, San Francisco stands out with a notably steeper decline in this trend. To further explore this phenomenon, it's crucial to examine employment trends, residential mobility patterns, and changes in land use within the area. By comparing data at both the zip code and county levels, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of the factors contributing to San Francisco's unique trajectory in rent burden reduction. This analysis will shed light on the complex interplay between economic factors, demographic shifts, and urban development policies shaping housing affordability in the Bay Area.
