My name is Anusha Bellapu and I’m a Master of City Planning student at University of California Berkeley. The focus of my work is land use and housing development and I’m deeply interested in the intersections of housing justice and land rights. 

I’m currently working as a Graduate Student Researcher at the Terner Centre for Housing Innovation on the development of a Housing Policy Simulator to illustrate the impact of land-use policy standards, financial incentives, current market trends on housing production in California. I’m also currently assisting Prof. Sai Balakrishnan in mapping and analyzing the geographic distribution of ancillary industries in Pune, India.

Before joining grad school, I worked as a researcher, urban planner and architect in India. When I’m not thinking about creating equitable solutions for cities, I spend my time catching up on anime, comedy and science fiction shows and feminist literature.
